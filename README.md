This program creates a restful endpoint that intakes a base64encoded FLAC audio file and stores the transcribed text into a DB table along with the time the request was made.

This is to be written in a framework you are familiar with, however we require unit tests and expect to see regular commits to demonstrate your approach to the task.Â 

Please submit this via a github repo link, with a README file. Include project setup steps and instructions to connect to your endpoint.
